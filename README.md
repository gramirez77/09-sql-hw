# 09-sql-hw

This is the homework for week 9 of UNC Data Analytics Boot Camp. This one is on SQL. I completed the bonus part as well. There are four files relevant in this repo:
* `erd.png` is the image file with the Entity Relationship Diagram.
* `schema.sql` is the file with the schema.
* `queries.sql` is the file with the queries.
* `bonus.ipnyb` is the Jupyter notebook with the bonus part of the homework.
